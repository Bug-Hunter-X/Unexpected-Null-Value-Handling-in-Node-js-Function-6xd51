# Unexpected Null Value Handling in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: the unexpected handling of null values. The `bug.js` file contains a function with potential null value issues; `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem:

The original code fails to gracefully handle situations where input values might be null. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
